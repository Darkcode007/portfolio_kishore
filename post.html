					Zymmo had a better UI design overall. They used the latest design trends like neuromorphic and enchanting color codes too. 
				</p>	
				
				
				<blockquote>
					Zymmo gets creators, consumers and brands together on one platform to enable discovery, collaboration and commerce. Food brands get to showcase their videos on Zymmo, drive sales through discovery, surface their entire inventory with delivery scheduling options, accept payments for sales and are able and fulfil last mile delivery to customers through integrated delivery solutions on Zymmo. 
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The major problem with the application includes, it's not user-friendly and very confusing. The organization has to manually notify the customers about the brilliant functionalities it had.

				<p>
					Since I had already used the app and had some idea about it, I decided to do an in-depth analysis of the app first. I wanted to understand the functionalities, overall architecture, and navigation.

				</p>	
				
				<p>
					Through the analysis, I was able to identify some clear usability issues and pain points. I listed all of them to validate them after my User Research.			</p>

				<h1 class="posttitle">User Interviews

			<div class="article-post">
				<p>
					I started my user research by conducting user <b>interviews with 7 users,</b> which vary from daily active users to infrequent users of any food app to understand what motivates or demotivates them while using this app.

				</p>	
				
				<p>
					Through the analysis, I was able to identify some clear usability issues and pain points. I listed all of them to validate them after my User Research.			</p>
		
					<div class="subhead">
						<h5 class="posttitle">Some key insights from the interview-

						</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Incomplete mobile app</li>
							<li>Confusing and cluttered UI</li>
							<li>No categorization</li>
							<li>Poor access to chefs</li>
							<li>Inappropriate notifications</li>
							<li>Long process for ordering food</li>
						  </ul>  
					</div>

					<div class="subhead">
						<h1 class="posttitle">Affinity Mapping

						</h1>
					</div>

					<p>
						Next, I compiled all the feedback, insights, and pain points listed above and grouped similar ones. This helped me brainstorm and develop potential ideas and gave a clearer view of what was important to users while keeping in mind the business goals and objectives.

						<h1 class="posttitle">Paper Sketches

						</h1>
					</div>

					<p>
						For paper wireframes, I carefully went through the UI of Zymmo's website and mobile site, its competitors, and other foodie and chef apps. After making some observations, I sketched out all the possible layout and finally came out with the one that worked the best. This allowed me to prototype solutions for the main screens before committing to high fidelity designs.
						Now that I had a better understanding of who I was designing for and felt equipped with my background research, I moved on to the good stuff!

						<h1 class="posttitle">Additional screens for better UX


						</h1>
					</div>
					<p>
						The user obviously tends to search for their favorite food for sure, The older design doesn't have functionality for search. Likewise, the location is also a big pain point in the older version, Because users may be traveling or they are ordering food from their office in the neighboring city. Hence I added a location page, and users can change their location on the homepage itself	</p>

					<h1 class="posttitle">Less screens, Better app flow


					</h1>
					<div class="article-post">
					<p>
						User has to be overcome the hectic process like login, OTP Verification, create account, add profile, add payment after installing the application, here what we have changed is, After installing application user can directly access the app's homepage without adding details and login. They can do that before checkout. This process helped customer to view the product before all these process. This helps to increase the customer retention rate to 80% than before

							<div class="article-post">
						<p>
							So often seemingly obvious but absolutely forgotten things emerge out of interviews and quick user tests. The task of Redesigning with better usability for a well-established application became something bigger and we analyzed the complete application and understood the complexity faced by the users. Pointed out the crucial pain points and rectified them using some simple but most convincing ideas. And it witnessed an increase in the sales to the client, the journey was inspiring us to do more good works that demand problem-solving, Analysing, Sketching, Usability testing, Affinity Mapping, Designing, Depicting user flow, etc.
