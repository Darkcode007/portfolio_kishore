					Scrapp is a ventures started in middle east and gulf region. Basically they allow users to buy or sell the bulk amount of scrap around UAE, This idea has many flaws as well as advantages. </p>	
				
				
				<blockquote>
					Scrapp (scrap business) is the upcoming application as well as a webiste focus on the companies as users to buy or sell bulk amount of scrap for example 200 ton steel scrap, Bulk amount of iron scrapp, etc. The deal demand a high revenue transactions and all, it was a different experience when compared to the normal e-commerce applications 		</blockquote>
				<p>
They need almost 5 different applications for users, employees, drivers, pickers, packers with consoles and admin dashboards. Here I am showcasing only one application				</p>

				<p>
					This application contains a website too. Hence the client needs exact same design for both of them. Also they need biding system to be implemented, for that they want users to pay downpayment first and on next session they need to pay final payment. It was a bit difficult task for us. We started brainstorming sessions about the possibilities and created the feature list of it. 
				</p>	
			</div>
			<div class="article-post">	
				<p>
					Through the analysis, I was able to identify some clear usability issues and pain points. I listed all of them to validate them after my User Research.			</p>

			<div class="subhead">
					<h5 class="posttitle">Some key pain points-

					</h5>

				<div class="article-post">
					<ul>
						<li>Biding confusions</li>
						<li>Payment gateway for the huge amount</li>
						<li>Buyer or Seller, Who will deliver this much bulk scrap?</li>
						<li>Downpayment criterias </li>

				<h1 class="posttitle">The Task

				</h1>
				<div class="article-post">
					<ul class="line-height">
						<li><i>To create Basic Design Guidelines including Typography, Color Palette</i></li>
						<li><i>To design Product Details Page (PDP), Cart or Bag Screen (where a bunch of products is added for trial)</i> </li>
						<li><i>To create Post-order journey screens (tracking after order after placement, rejecting or accepting the products post-trial and making payments for accepted products)</i></li>
						<li><i>To create Information Design and Hierarchy (Communicate the entire Trial Model, Trial Fees, Conditions,</i></li>
						
					  </ul>

				<div class="article-post">
				
				<p>
					The flowchart below outlines the core stages of my design process. I chose to take an iterative approach, testing and improving the design throughout.

					<div class="subhead">
						<h5 class="posttitle">Pain Point 1 
						</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="article-post">

					<p>
						The bidding process is one of the major pain points, because many clients can involve in bidding process and owner has to choose wisely the bidder. After that owner has to collect Downpayment from the bidder. 					</p>	

					</div>
					<div class="subhead">
						<h5 class="posttitle">Pain Point 2
						</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="article-post">

					<p>
						Huge payment, This is the another challenge for me, because huge money transfer is not possible is normal payment gateways, and payments may from outside of the UAE. Hence we need to figure out this situation also with limited resource and finance clients have.  	</p>	

					</div>
					<div class="subhead">
						<h5 class="posttitle">Pain Point 3
						</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="article-post">

					<p>
						Buyer or Seller, Who will deliver this bulk amount of scrap? Deal should close only after the item reached buyers side. Then only buyer can pay final amount. And this much huge amount will take more time to process also. </p>	

					</div>
					<div class="subhead">
						<h5 class="posttitle">Pain Point 4
						</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="article-post">

					<p> Downpayment and Final payment, Both are complex task that, the downpayment should hold by some kind of third party like stripe. This much huge amount may cause additional taxes and processing fee, though client has not interested in it. </p>

						The user obviously tends to search for their favorite food for sure, The older design doesn't have functionality for search. Likewise, the location is also a big pain point in the older version, Because users may be traveling or they are ordering food from their office in the neighboring city. Hence I added a location page, and users can change their location on the homepage itself	</p>

				<div class="article-post">
				<p>
					The best part of a design system is making components, this process helped me to faster design time 3x than the manual corrections. almost all buttons, fields and Navigation are made up of components. All these component fields and boxes are auto aligned, hence the text overflow will automatically manage by the component system.	</p>

						</h1>
						<div class="article-post">
						<p>
							Finally, Creating an omnichannel platform was hardly memorable. The task of implementing a better usability for a well-established application became something bigger and The Userflow we created helped us to maintain the workflow too. Pointed out the crucial pain points and rectified them using some simple but most convincing ideas. And it witnessed an excellent application for the client, the journey was inspiring us to do more good works that demand problem-solving, Analysing, Sketching, Usability testing, Affinity Mapping, Designing, Depicting user flow, etc.
